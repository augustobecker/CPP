Bounded buffer

The bounded-buffer problems (aka the producer-consumer problem)
is a classic example of concurrent access to a shared resource.
A bounded buffer lets multiple producers and multiple consumers 
share a single buffer. Producers write data to the buffer and consumers
read data from the buffer.
Producers must block if the buffer is full.
Consumers must block if the buffer is empty.
A bounded buffer with capacity N has can store N data items.
The places used to store the data items inside the bounded buffer are called slots.
Without proper synchronization the following errors may occur:
*   The producers doesn’t block when the buffer is full.
*   A Consumer consumes an empty slot in the buffer.
*   A consumer attempts to consume a slot that is only half-filled by a producer.
*    Two producers writes into the same slot.
*   Two consumers reads the same slot.
*   And possibly more …
