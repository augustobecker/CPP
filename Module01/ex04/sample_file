Bounded buffer

The bounded-buffer problems (aka the producer-  problem)
is a classic example of concurrent access to a shared resource.
A bounded buffer lets multiple producers and multiple  s 
share a single buffer. Producers write data to the buffer and  s
read data from the buffer.

Producers must block if the buffer is full.
 s must block if the buffer is empty.
A bounded buffer with capacity N has can store N data items.
The places used to store the data items inside the bounded buffer are called slots.
Without proper synchronization the following errors may occur:
*   The producers doesn’t block when the buffer is full.
*   A   consumes an empty slot in the buffer.
*   A   attempts to consume a slot that is only half-filled by a producer.
*    Two producers writes into the same slot.
*   Two  s reads the same slot.
*   And possibly more …
